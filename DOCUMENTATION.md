# DOCUMENTATION

SPG uses '*blocks*' for holding predefined text sources

## Predefined Blocks

| Block Name   | Information |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| `__info__`   | Contains information about SPG Generator (version etc.) **Content Changes for output type**|
| `__version__`| Contains version information

When generating document output SPG goes each line for determining *line mode*
if a line starts with '\*' and ends with '\*\*' line is interpreted as a *command line*
a *command line* should always return a string to generated documents source.
 if the line is not a *command line*, the content of the line is written to document output

## *Comment Line*
A Comment line is a line starts with `--` and the line content is not written into document output

## *Magic Line*
A Magic Line is a line that starts with the % character. Any magic expressions within the line are converted based on the documentâ€™s output format.

For example:

In HTML output, `{hr}` is converted to `<hr>`.

In TXT output, the same expression becomes `---`.

The Magic Line mechanism allows flexible formatting depending on the output type.


## *Command Line*
A command line have two parts a `command_name` and `argument`.
command name and argument is needs to be seperated by a `:`
